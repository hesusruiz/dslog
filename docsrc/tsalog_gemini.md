# DSLog (Decentralized Scalable Log) - A Verifiable Timestamping Service with Global Consistency

## Overview

DSLog combines the established  [**RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)**](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3161) with modern [**Tiled Transparency Logs**](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-tiles.md) and a **public-permissioned blockchain** (ISBE Blockchain, based on BESU) to create a highly robust, verifiable, and globally consistent timestamping service. This hybrid approach addresses critical limitations of traditional timestamping, providing strong guarantees of data existence, inclusion, and immutability without requiring blind trust in any single operator.

The timestamping service described here is just one of many different "personalities" that can be implemented using the underlying Decentralized Scalable Log (DSLog) infrastructure. In other words, the general DSLog mechanism allows logging data entries with arbitrary data models. The concrete example described here uses data entries as specified in RFC 3161, but DSLog can be used to create logging systems specialized in a use case-specific data model.

This document describes a timestamping service which can be used by many types of applications.

## Purpose and Challenges Solved

Traditional timestamping services, while providing proof of existence at a specific time, rely heavily on the trustworthiness of the Time Stamping Authority (TSA), the entity operating the service. If a malicious TSA were to backdate timestamps or selectively omit entries, detecting such misbehavior would be challenging. DSLog aims to solve these fundamental challenges:

1. **Trust in Timestamps:** Move beyond trusting a single TSA by cryptographically linking timestamps to a publicly auditable log.

2. **Proof of Inclusion:** Provide verifiable proof that a data entry was not only timestamped but also permanently recorded in a tamper-evident log.

3. **Non-Repudiation for Log Operators:** Ensure that the log operator cannot deny the logging of an entry once it has been accepted and an index returned. This holds the operator accountable for censorship or selective logging.

4. **Global Consistency (Split-View Attacks):** Eliminate the risk of "split-view attacks," where a malicious log presents different views of its contents to different users. This is achieved by anchoring the log's state to a Byzantine-tolerant blockchain.

5. **Scalable Verification:** Enable clients to efficiently verify proofs of inclusion without requiring the log server to generate them on demand, leveraging the Tiled Transparency Logs API.

6. **Trust Minimization:** Reduce the need for absolute trust in any single entity (TSA or log operator) by relying on cryptographic proofs and a distributed, verifiable ledger.

## Beyond Global Order: Why DSLog's Partial Order is a Better Fit for Traceability

A common but naive approach to building decentralized logging systems is to write every single entry as a transaction on a blockchain. While this seems to offer maximum security, it introduces fundamental architectural constraints that are both unnecessary and detrimental for most real-world traceability use cases, which are not related to cryptocurrencies.

* **The Bottleneck of Forced Serialization:** Blockchains, by their very nature, enforce a **total global order**. Every transaction from every participant must be serialized into a single, linear chain. This is a critical requirement for cryptocurrencies to prevent double-spending, but it is an artificial constraint for most other applications. The real world is highly concurrent; events in a supply chain, for example, happen simultaneously in different factories, warehouses, and vehicles. Forcing these concurrent events into a single, global queue creates a massive performance bottleneck and does not reflect the reality of the system being modeled.

* **Partial Order is Sufficient and More Natural:** Most traceability use cases do not require a total global order of _all_ events in the ecosystem. What is typically needed is a **partial order** (mathematically, a structure like a join semi-lattice):
    * We need to know the exact order of a sequence of events _within a specific context_ (e.g., all steps that happened to a single product batch).
    * We need to prove that an event happened _before_ a certain point in time (e.g., before a compliance audit).
    * We do _not_ need to know whether an event in Factory A happened before or after an unrelated event in Factory B that occurred at roughly the same time. These events are concurrent and are not causally related.

* **DSLog's Natively Concurrent Architecture:** The DSLog architecture embraces this reality. By supporting multiple, independent logs (as described in the federation model), it allows for concurrent event streams.
    * Each log provides a strict, total order for its own entries, which is perfect for context-specific traceability.
    * The ecosystem as a whole operates on a partial order. All logs are periodically anchored to the same blockchain, creating common points in time for cross-log synchronization, but they are not forced into a single, slow-moving queue.

This approach avoids the scalability limitations of writing everything on-chain and provides a model that is a more accurate and efficient representation of concurrent, real-world systems. It delivers the necessary trust and verifiability without the unnecessary constraints of a globally serialized ledger.

## Performance and Scalability: High Throughput with High Trust

A key design advantage of DSLog is its ability to provide strong, blockchain-backed trust guarantees without incurring the performance and cost penalties of writing every entry directly to a blockchain.

* **High-Throughput Ingestion:** The core log operations (adding entries) are handled by the highly optimized Tessera log, which can ingest thousands of entries per second. This is orders of magnitude faster than the transaction throughput of most blockchain networks. Writing to the log is a fast, local operation, decoupled from blockchain consensus latency.

* **Batching via Blockchain Anchoring:** Instead of committing each timestamp individually, DSLog batches thousands of entries into a single cryptographic commitmentâ€”the Signed Tree Head (STH). Only this small, constant-size STH is periodically written to the ISBE Blockchain. This dramatically reduces on-chain traffic, transaction fees, and storage requirements.

* **Preserving Trust Properties:** This batching mechanism does not compromise trust. The Merkle tree structure ensures that the STH is a commitment to _every single entry_ in the batch. Any attempt to tamper with a past entry would change the STH, which would be detected during verification against the immutable anchor on the blockchain. Global consistency is still guaranteed by the blockchain-anchored checkpoints.

* **Scalable Client-Side Verification:** The Tiled Transparency Log API offloads the work of generating inclusion proofs from the server to the client. Clients can efficiently download only the small pieces of the Merkle tree ("tiles") they need to verify their entries, making the verification process highly scalable and placing minimal load on the central log server.

* **Ecosystem Scalability via many logs:** The DSLog architecture is not monolithic. The entire ecosystem can scale horizontally by deploying multiple, independent log instances. Different operators can run logs for general use or for specific use cases (e.g., a dedicated log for a healthcare consortium, another for a financial services network). Each of these logs operates independently at high speed, anchoring its own checkpoints to the shared ISBE Blockchain. This federated model allows the total system throughput to grow linearly with the number of logs, providing massive scalability and specialization without creating a central bottleneck.

In summary, DSLog achieves the "best of both worlds": **the high performance and low latency of a centralized log for write operations, combined with the decentralized, tamper-evident trust and global consistency of a blockchain for verification and auditing**.

## Properties Provided by DSLog

* **Timestamped Proof of Inclusion:** Clients gain cryptographic proof that their data existed at a specific time (from the RFC 3161 token) AND was included in a public, verifiable log (from the Checkpoint anchored to the blockchain).

* **Global Consistency:** The ISBE Blockchain anchoring of STHs prevents "split-view attacks," ensuring all users eventually observe the same, consistent view of the log's contents.

* **Auditability & Transparency:** Any party can independently audit the log's integrity and verify entries by fetching tiles and checking against blockchain-committed STHs.

* **Non-Censorship / Non-Denial:** Once an entry is accepted and its index returned, the log operator cannot deny its inclusion without being cryptographically detected.

* **Trust Minimization:** Trust is shifted from a single, fallible operator to cryptographic proofs and the distributed consensus of the ISBE Blockchain.

* **Security:** Leverages strong cryptographic primitives for hashing, signing, and tree integrity.

* **Interoperability:** Built upon widely recognized standards (RFC 3161, C2SP Tiled Logs, C2SP Witness Protocol).

## The DSLog Approach: A Hybrid Model

DSLog operates as a "personality" of a transparent log, integrating several key components:

* **RFC 3161 TSA Personality:** This component acts as the primary interface for clients. It receives standard RFC 3161 `TimeStampReq` messages, verifies that they comply with the standard, processes them, and issues `TimeStampResp` tokens.

* **Tessera Log Backend:** The `github.com/transparency-dev/tessera` library is used as the core append-only, cryptographic log. When a `TimeStampReq` is received, its payload (the raw request bytes) is added as a leaf entry to the Tessera log.

* **Tiled Transparency Logs API:** The Tessera log publishes its data and Merkle tree structure in a "tiled" format, conforming to the [C2SP Tiled Transparency Logs API](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-tiles.md). This allows clients to efficiently retrieve only the necessary portions of the log to construct and verify inclusion proofs themselves.

* **ISBE Witness and Blockchain Anchor:** The ISBE Witness is a lightweight, standalone application that implements the [C2SP Transparency Log Witness Protocol](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-witness.md). Its role is to:
    1. Receive [Checkpoints](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-checkpoint.md) from one or more DSLog instances.
    2. Cryptographically verify that each new Checkpoint is a consistent extension of the previous Checkpoint it has seen for that log.
    3. Commit the verified Checkpoint to the ISBE Blockchain (a public-permissioned BESU network).
    4. Return a timestamped co-signature to the log operator.

    This process provides the global consistency guarantee. Because the witness's logic is fully defined by the public protocol and its actions are recorded on an immutable public ledger, it does not need to be a trusted third party. In fact, an ISBE Witness can be operated by the same entity as the log itself without reducing the system's trust properties. Any attempt by a co-located witness to approve an inconsistent log state would be a publicly provable violation of the protocol. This makes the witness simple and cheap to operate while providing powerful security guarantees.

### Key Mechanisms and Standards

DSLog leverages several established cryptographic and distributed system standards:

* **RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP):** The de-jure standard for timestamping digital data. DSLog uses this for the initial proof of existence.

* **ASN.1 / DER:** The underlying encoding standard for RFC 3161 messages.

* **Tessera (`github.com/transparency-dev/tessera`):** A Go library providing efficient, verifiable, append-only Merkle tree logs. It generates Signed Tree Heads (STHs) as cryptographic commitments to the log's state.

* **Tiled Transparency Logs API (`tlog-tiles.md`):** A de-facto standard for serving log data in a highly efficient, client-verifiable manner. Clients can download specific "tiles" (portions of the Merkle tree) to reconstruct proofs.

* **ISBE Witness and Blockchain Anchoring:** The system uses the C2SP Transparency Log Witness Protocol (`tlog-witness.md`) to achieve global consistency. An **ISBE Witness** receives log checkpoints (STHs), verifies their consistency, and anchors them on the **ISBE Blockchain (BESU)**. This public, immutable record prevents split-view attacks and makes the log's history universally auditable.

* **Custom Log Index Extension:** A custom ASN.1 extension embedded within the RFC 3161 `TimeStampResp` (specifically in the `TSTInfo` structure). This extension carries the `uint64` index of the entry in the Tessera log, allowing clients to later request inclusion proofs.

#### ASN.1 Log Index Extension Definition

To link an RFC 3161 timestamp with its corresponding entry in the transparent log, DSLog defines a custom extension. This extension is included in the `extensions` field of the `TSTInfo` structure within the `TimeStampToken`.

* **Object Identifier (OID):** A unique OID must be assigned to identify this extension. For private use, an OID under the Private Enterprise Number (PEN) arc is recommended.
    * **Example OID:** `1.3.6.1.4.1.99999.1.1` (where `99999` is the PEN of the organization operating the DSLog).

* **ASN.1 Syntax:** The value of the extension (`extnValue`) is the DER-encoded representation of a single ASN.1 `INTEGER`. The value represents the 0-based index of the entry in the Tessera log.

    ```asn1
    -- The value associated with the Log Index Extension OID
    -- is a single INTEGER representing the 0-based index
    -- of the entry in the Tessera log.
    LogIndex ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)
    ```

* **Encoding:** The `extnValue` field of the `Extension` structure is an `OCTET STRING` containing the DER-encoded `LogIndex`. For a `logIndex` of `12345`, the `INTEGER` would be encoded as `[02 03 00 30 39]`. The `extnValue` would therefore be the bytes `02 03 00 30 39`.

* **Criticality:** This extension should be marked as **non-critical** (the `critical` field of the `Extension` structure is set to `FALSE` or omitted). This ensures that legacy or non-DSLog-aware clients can still validate the basic RFC 3161 timestamp signature without understanding the log index extension.

### DSLog Operational Flow

1. **Client Request:** An application hashes its data and constructs an RFC 3161 `TimeStampReq`.

2. **TSA Processing:** The DSLog server receives the `TimeStampReq`. It then adds the _raw `TimeStampReq` bytes_ as a new leaf entry to its Tessera log. Tessera processes this entry and returns a unique `logIndex`.

3. **Response with Index:** The DSLog server generates an RFC 3161 `TimeStampResp`. This response includes a `TimeStampToken` (signed by the TSA) asserting the time, and a custom extension containing the `logIndex` of the newly added entry in Tessera.

4. **Client Storage:** The client stores the original data, the `TimeStampReq`, the `TimeStampToken`, and the received `logIndex`.

5. **Background Checkpointing (Log Operator):** Periodically, the Tessera log generates a new Signed Tree Head (STH), cryptographically committing to all entries up to that point. The DSLog server then submits this STH to the ISBE Witness component via the Transparency Log Witness Protocol.

6. **Blockchain Anchoring (ISBE Witness):** The ISBE Witness verifies the consistency of the submitted STH with its previously recorded state. Upon successful verification, it commits the STH to the ISBE Blockchain, providing a globally consistent, immutable record of the log's state. The Witness returns a timestamped cosignature.

7. **Client Verification (Any Time, Any Party):**

   * To prove inclusion, a client first obtains a _trusted_ STH from the ISBE Blockchain (via the ISBE Witness or directly).

   * Using the `logIndex` (from the initial `TimeStampResp`) and the `TreeSize` from the trusted STH, the client retrieves the necessary Merkle tree "tiles" from the public Tiled Transparency Log server.

   * The client then locally reconstructs and verifies the Merkle Inclusion Proof for its entry against the `RootHash` of the trusted STH.

   * The combination of the original RFC 3161 `TimeStampToken` (signed by the TSA) and the verified Merkle Inclusion Proof (anchored to the blockchain) provides irrefutable "Timestamped Proof of Inclusion."

## Threat Model and Defenses

The DSLog architecture is designed to operate in a trust-minimized environment where individual components could be compromised. The security of the system relies on public verifiability and cryptographic proofs rather than blind trust in any single operator.

### Key Threat: Compromised TSA Signing Key

This is one of the most critical threats to a timestamping service.

* **The Threat:** An attacker who gains control of the TSA's private signing key can create fraudulent `TimeStampResp` tokens for any data, at any point in time (e.g., backdating a signature). In a traditional TSA model, this misbehavior is undetectable and completely undermines the system's integrity.

* **The DSLog Defense: Public, Verifiable Auditing:** DSLog's defense is not to prevent the fraudulent signature itself, but to make its fraudulent nature **publicly detectable and provable**. A timestamp's validity in DSLog is not derived from the TSA signature alone, but from the combination of the signature and its corresponding **Timestamped Proof of Inclusion** in the globally consistent log.

    1. **Append-Only Log:** To be considered valid, the fraudulent timestamp must be entered into the Tessera log. The log is strictly append-only. An attacker cannot insert an entry into the log's past without invalidating the entire Merkle tree from that point forward.

    2. **Conflicting Timelines:** The attacker must add the entry for the backdated timestamp to the *current* end of the log. This entry will then be included in the next Signed Tree Head (STH) checkpoint that is anchored to the ISBE Blockchain.

    3. **Provable Misbehavior:** An auditor or client verifying this timestamp will discover a cryptographic contradiction:
        * The `TimeStampToken` will claim the event occurred at a past time, `T_fraud`.
        * The Merkle Inclusion Proof will show that the entry was added to the log at a later time, `T_actual`, as proven by the timestamp of the blockchain block containing the corresponding STH.

    This discrepancy provides irrefutable proof that the TSA misbehaved by issuing a backdated timestamp. The trust is therefore placed in the public, immutable audit trail, not in the secrecy of the TSA key.

            Tessera_Log -->> DSLog_TSA: Returns logIndex
            DSLog_TSA -->> Attacker: Returns TimeStampResp
            Tessera_Log ->> ISBE_Blockchain: Periodically anchor new STH (containing entry)
            note right of ISBE_Blockchain: Block timestamp is T_actual

            Auditor ->> ISBE_Blockchain: Fetch trusted STH and its block time (T_actual)
            Auditor ->> Tessera_Log: Fetch inclusion proof using logIndex
            Auditor ->> Auditor: 1. Verify inclusion proof against STH
            Auditor ->> Auditor: 2. Compare token time (T_fraud) with STH anchor time (T_actual)
            Auditor ->> Auditor: Proof: T_fraud is much earlier than T_actual
    ```

### Other Threats and Mitigations

* **Log Tampering (Retroactive Modification):** Any attempt to alter or delete a past entry in the Tessera log would change its leaf hash, which would ripple up the Merkle tree and result in a different `RootHash`. This new `RootHash` would not match the one already anchored on the immutable ISBE Blockchain, making the tampering immediately obvious to any verifier.

* **Log Equivocation (Split-View Attack):** A malicious log operator might try to show different versions of the log to different users. The ISBE Witness and the blockchain anchor prevent this. The Witness only accepts STHs that are consistent extensions of the previous STH it has seen. Since the sequence of STHs is recorded on the public blockchain, all users can converge on a single, globally consistent view of the log's history.

* **Entry Omission / Censorship:** If a client receives a `TimeStampResp` with a `logIndex` but can never find the entry in the public log or generate a valid inclusion proof, it serves as evidence of misbehavior. The client can prove they submitted the request and received an acknowledgment, holding the operator accountable.

## Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance

The DSLog architecture is designed with data privacy regulations like GDPR in mind, particularly addressing the "right to erasure" (Article 17). This is achieved by carefully separating the data layer from the immutable blockchain layer.

* **No Personal Data On-Chain:** The ISBE Blockchain only stores Signed Tree Heads (STHs). These are cryptographic hashes (commitments) of the log's state and contain no personally identifiable information (PII) or raw data from the log entries. They are irreversible and cannot be used to deduce the original content.

* **Pseudonymization by Design:** Clients are responsible for hashing their sensitive data *before* creating the RFC 3161 `TimeStampReq`. The log entry itself is the `TimeStampReq` containing this hash, not the original data. This aligns with the principle of data minimization.

* **Fulfilling the Right to Erasure:**
    *   Since the Tessera log is stored off-chain in a conventional storage system (e.g., filesystem, S3), individual log entries can be deleted or redacted upon a valid erasure request.
    *   Deleting a leaf from the Merkle tree will change the STH for all subsequent checkpoints. This means a proof of inclusion for the deleted entry can no longer be generated against future log states, effectively honoring the erasure.
    *   Crucially, this action **does not invalidate the integrity of the rest of the log**. Proofs for all other entries, anchored by STHs committed to the blockchain *before* the deletion, remain valid. The historical record is preserved, while the specific entry is verifiably removed from the log's present and future states.

This model provides a robust solution for maintaining a tamper-evident, auditable log while remaining compliant with privacy regulations that require the ability to delete personal data. It offers verifiability without the "inescapable permanence" of writing raw data directly to a blockchain.

## Log Replication, Availability, and Censorship Resistance

To further enhance the robustness of the ecosystem, a DSLog instance can be replicated by independent, third-party **mirrors**. These mirrors operate by fetching the log's tiles, verifying their consistency against the STHs anchored on the ISBE Blockchain, and serving them to clients. This model, inspired by the [C2SP Transparency Log Mirror Protocol](https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/tlog-mirror.md), provides several key advantages:

* **High Availability and Redundancy:** If the primary log operator's server becomes unavailable, clients can seamlessly switch to fetching log tiles from one or more independent mirrors. This ensures that the verification process is not dependent on a single point of failure.

* **Censorship Resistance:** Mirrors provide a powerful defense against censorship. If a malicious primary operator attempts to hide an entry by refusing to serve its corresponding tiles to a specific user, that user can retrieve the same tiles from a mirror. Since all mirrors are cryptographically bound to the same public history on the blockchain, any attempt by the primary log to present an inconsistent or incomplete view is easily detected.

* **Improved Performance and Scalability:** By distributing the load of serving log tiles across multiple geographically diverse mirrors, the system can serve a larger number of clients with lower latency.

* **Independent Auditing:** Mirrors act as continuous, independent auditors of the primary log, strengthening the overall trust and security of the system.

This replication mechanism is particularly effective for logs containing public or semi-public data. For logs with sensitive data, the decision to allow replication must be balanced with data residency and confidentiality requirements.


## Pathway to eIDAS Qualified Timestamping Services

The robust architecture of DSLog provides a strong technical foundation for entities aspiring to become a **Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)** for timestamping under the EU's **eIDAS Regulation (EU) No 910/2014**. Qualified timestamps have a presumed legal effect across all EU member states, making them suitable for high-stakes legal, financial, and regulatory use cases.

While achieving full QTSP status involves rigorous organizational audits and procedural controls, DSLog's design directly addresses and often exceeds the technical requirements outlined in relevant ETSI standards, such as **ETSI EN 319 422 ("Time-stamping protocol and time-stamp profiles")**.

Here is how DSLog's features map to the principles of a Qualified Timestamping Service:

* **Enhanced Integrity and Non-Repudiation:** The ETSI standards require strong protections against forgery and alteration of timestamps. DSLog's core RFC 3161 compliance meets the baseline, but the addition of the transparent log provides a superior, publicly verifiable layer of integrity. Any attempt to issue a fraudulent timestamp or tamper with the log's history becomes cryptographically detectable by any third party, offering a level of non-repudiation that is far stronger than traditional, opaque systems.

* **Verifiable Audit Trail:** QTSPs are subject to strict auditing. The combination of the append-only Tessera log and the immutable blockchain anchor creates a comprehensive and irrefutable audit trail of every timestamping operation. This allows auditors to independently verify the log's consistency and the inclusion of every timestamp, greatly simplifying compliance verification.

* **Operator Accountability:** A core principle of eIDAS is holding the provider accountable. By making the log's state public and consistent, DSLog removes the ability for a malicious or compromised operator to misbehave undetectably (e.g., via backdating or split-view attacks). This transparency provides the ultimate form of accountability.

* **High Availability and Reliability:** The architecture's support for independent mirrors and its reliance on a distributed blockchain network for anchoring contribute directly to the high-availability and disaster recovery requirements mandated for qualified services.

In summary, DSLog provides the advanced cryptographic and architectural mechanisms to build a timestamping service that is not only compliant but also demonstrably more trustworthy and resilient than what is minimally required. An organization can leverage DSLog as the core of its technical infrastructure, focusing its remaining efforts on the necessary organizational, physical security, and legal procedures to achieve full QTSP certification.


## Economic and Governance Models

The decentralized and federated architecture of DSLog allows for flexible and sustainable economic and governance models, tailored to different use cases. The system's operation can be broken down into three key roles:

### 1. DSLog Instance Operators

A DSLog instance is the service that accepts timestamp requests and manages the Tessera log.

* **Economic Models:**
    * **Public Good:** A large organization or non-profit might operate a public DSLog for the benefit of an entire ecosystem (similar to public Certificate Transparency logs), subsidizing its operational costs.
    * **Commercial Service:** A "Timestamping-as-a-Service" (TaaS) provider can charge fees based on usage (e.g., per-timestamp or subscription tiers).
    * **Consortium-Funded:** A log dedicated to a specific industry (e.g., finance, logistics) can be funded collectively by the consortium members who rely on it.
    * **Private/Internal:** An organization can run a private DSLog for its own internal audit and traceability needs, treating it as an operational cost center.
* **Governance:** The log operator is responsible for defining its service policies, such as data retention, uptime SLAs, and pricing. In a consortium model, these rules would be established by the consortium's governing body.

### 2. The ISBE Witness Network

The ISBE Witness is a lightweight component that verifies log consistency and anchors checkpoints to the blockchain.

* **Economic Models:** Since witnesses are simple and cheap to operate, their operation can be highly accessible.
    *   **Volunteer / Pro-bono:** Independent auditors, academic institutions, or ecosystem enthusiasts can run witnesses as a public good to enhance the network's overall security and decentralization.
    *   **Bundled Service:** A log operator can run its own witness, as the trust model does not require the witness to be a separate entity. Blockchain validators may also be expected to run a witness as part of their duties.
* **Governance:** The primary governance for a witness is the strict, automated C2SP protocol it must follow. Misbehavior is publicly detectable, so formal governance is minimal. The broader ecosystem governance involves the social consensus of which independent witnesses are considered reliable.

### 3. The ISBE Blockchain Validators

The ISBE Blockchain is a public-permissioned network, meaning a known set of entities operates the validator nodes.

* **Economic Models:** Validators bear the cost of running a blockchain node. Transaction fees (gas) can be kept extremely low and stable, designed only to prevent spam and cover collective network maintenance costs, not for speculation.
* **Governance:** This is the most formal governance layer, typically managed by a foundation or a multi-party legal agreement between the permissioned validators. This governing body is responsible for:
    * Defining the criteria and process for adding or removing validator nodes.
    * Coordinating network upgrades.
    * Overseeing the overall health and strategic direction of the blockchain network.

## Usage Examples (Client Perspective - Conceptual)

A client application would typically perform the following steps:

1. **Generate Data Hash:**

   ```
   data := []byte("My important document content.")
   hasher := sha256.New()
   hasher.Write(data)
   digest := hasher.Sum(nil)
   ```

2. **Create RFC 3161 TimeStamp Request:**

   ```
   // Using github.com/digitorus/timestamp
   req, err := timestamp.CreateRequest(digest, nil) // Or with nonce/certReq options
   // ... handle error ...
   ```

3. **Send Request to DSLog TSA:**

   ```
   // HTTP POST to http://dslog.example.com/tsa
   // Set Content-Type: application/timestamp-query
   // Send req bytes in body
   resp, err := http.Post("http://dslog.example.com/tsa", "application/timestamp-query", bytes.NewReader(req))
   // ... handle response, read body ...
   ```

4. **Parse Response and Extract Log Index:**

   ```
   tsRespBytes, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
   // ... handle error ...
   ts, err := timestamp.ParseResponse(tsRespBytes)
   // ... handle error ...

   var logIndex uint64
   for _, ext := range ts.Extensions {
       if ext.Id.Equal(tsaext.OIDLogIndexExtension) { // Your custom OID
           logIndex, err = tsaext.ParseLogIndexExtension(ext.Value)
           // ... handle error ...
           fmt.Printf("Entry logged at index: %d\n", logIndex)
           break
       }
   }
   // Store original data, ts, and logIndex for later verification
   ```

5. **Later: Obtain Trusted STH (from ISBE Blockchain):**

   * This step involves interacting with the ISBE Blockchain (e.g., via a BESU client or a dedicated API) to retrieve a recent, trusted Signed Tree Head (STH) that has been committed by the ISBE Witness. The STH will provide a `TreeSize` and `RootHash`.

6. **Later: Retrieve Log Tiles and Verify Inclusion Proof:**

   * Using the `logIndex` and the `TreeSize` from the trusted STH, the client calculates the necessary tile URLs according to the `tlog-tiles.md` specification.

   * The client fetches these tiles from the public log server (e.g., `http://tlog.example.com/tile/...`).

   * The client then uses a Tessera client library (or similar) to locally reconstruct the Merkle path and verify the inclusion of its original `TimeStampReq` (or its hash) against the `RootHash` of the trusted STH.

## Deployment Considerations

* **Secure Key Management:** Robust handling of the TSA's signing key and the Tessera checkpoint signing key is paramount (e.g., using HSMs).

* **HTTPS:** All public-facing API endpoints (TSA, Tiled Log server) must use HTTPS.

* **Persistent Storage:** The Tessera log backend requires reliable, persistent storage (e.g., POSIX filesystem, S3).

* **ISBE Witness Deployment:** A separate, highly available ISBE Witness instance is required to interact with the ISBE Blockchain.

* **Blockchain Connectivity:** The ISBE Witness needs reliable connectivity to the ISBE Blockchain network.

* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Comprehensive monitoring of all components (TSA, Tessera, Witness, Blockchain) is essential.
